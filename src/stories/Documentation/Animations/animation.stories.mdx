# Animation

Animation is defined by multiple properties which include `visibilityThreshold`, `animationTrajectories`, and `springConfig`.

## visibilityThreshold

VisibilityThreshold is used to determine the point at which the animation of objects in a scene should begin with respect to the scene's position relative to the screen. It takes two parameters: `sceneTopToScreenBottomRatio` and `sceneBottomToScreenTopRatio`. As the scroll is bi-directional, bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom, one has to define these two values for animations. Both these values represent the threshold to begin the animation in the direction of scroll.
Lets understand using an example, while scrolling from top to bottom, as soon as the distance between sceneTop and screenBottom pass the threshold `sceneTopToScreenBottomRatio` value, animation will begin. Similarly, while scrolling from bottom to top, as soon as the distance between sceneBottom and screenTop pass the threshold `sceneBottomToScreenTopRatio` value, animation will begin.

## animationTrajectories

AnimationTrajectories refers to the animation behaviour to be applied to any object. One can select from the given animation Trajectories or form a custom Trajectory using a combination of the predefined Trajectories. For more information, refer to the Trajectory documentation.

## springConfig

Animations can be scroll-based, spring-based or time-based. For spring-based animations, the animation is defined by a springConfig. Spring config has the following parameters: mass, tension, friction and duration. Each of these parameters can be altered in order to change the nature of the animation.
